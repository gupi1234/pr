            Businesses that create activity on social platforms can see growth
            in interaction and conversations about the brand and products. Users
            will comment on and share posts, tag the company in their own posts,
            and even begin communicating through the instant messaging
            functionalities. These types of interactions are ideal because there
            are notifications in place to alert social media managers. This
            enables them to practice good customer service, which in turns
            boosts the customer <a href="https://www.jnee.us/de/g-workspace-business-project-collab-online-flexible-system-platform?suffix=false&r_campaign=20349976722&utm_campaign=20349976722&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_type=search&utm_campaign=20349976722&gad=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhd79_96EgAMVEZlmAh2t9gobEAAYAiAAEgKnT_D_BwE">experience</a>. People on social media may also
            discuss a brand, product or service without tagging or speaking
            directly to a company. There are several social media listening
            tools available to stay plugged into the conversation, such as
            Brandwatch, NetBase Quid and Sprinklr. Free tools such as Google
            Alerts can also notify marketers when their company is being
            mentioned.
